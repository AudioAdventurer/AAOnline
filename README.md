# AAOnline Overview
AAOnline is a text based game engine designed to support a variety of play modes and Server Implmentations. 
The primary game mode is intended to be audio based, but the system should support text playing.  The initial 
intent is not to implement a telnet based play mode like you would find on a MUD.  

This project draws from concepts and code defined in WheelMud.  Thanks to all contributors of that project for the
work done over more than 10 years.  For more information on that project and it's contributors see

## Server Implementations

1. Stand alone console app that can be used for testing in text mode.  
2. Web based User interface for playing in text mode.
3. Alexa based implementation.
4. Web based enhancements for audio playing.

## Other tool plans

1. Web based world builder - Designed to create multiple adventures that tie back to a single world/universe.
